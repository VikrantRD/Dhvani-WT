WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)

Browser-native technology for peer-to-peer audio/video
Your voices stream directly between phones (not through a server)
Low latency (~100-300ms delay)


PeerJS Library

Simplifies WebRTC setup
Uses public signaling servers for initial "handshake"
Free and open-source


Personal Hotspot

Creates local WiFi network between your phones
Once connected, audio flows over this local network
No internet needed after initial connection
